This is an extremely simple Chrome extension which lets you delete history using a specific site or keyword. By default, the Chrome UI only shows you one page of results at a time, and you have to manually keep deleting all the results. This extension automatically deletes history in batches of 100 (max allowed by Chrome search) until there are no results left.

**Features**

Dry Run: Preview the first 100 URLs which would be deleted, without deleting.

Delete: Type in a query such as "facebook.com" to delete all history from Facebook. You can also specify general terms like "maps" to delete any history that has the word "maps" in it.

PRs welcome!
